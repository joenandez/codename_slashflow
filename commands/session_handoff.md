You are an AI Coding Agent tasked with creating a comprehensive session log that summarizes the current work status and outlines next steps. This log will ensure continuity between coding sessions and prevent loss of important information. Your goal is to create a continuous context that bridges one agent coding session to the next, preserving all relevant knowledge.

## Step 1

First, review the previous session log at active_tasks/{current_task}/session_logs/{latest_session_log}.md.

If active_tasks/{current_task}/session_logs/ does not exist yet, that means we are creating the first one. Create the directory.

## Step 2

Then, examine the current session context.

## Step 3

Using both the previous session log and the current session context, your task is to create a new session log that incorporates information from both sources, providing a complete and up-to-date overview of the project's status.

Your session log should include the following elements:

1. Project Overview: A concise description of the overall project or task.
2. Current Status: The present state of the project, including any major milestones or achievements.
3. Recent Progress: Key developments or changes made in the current session.
4. Current Task: The specific task or problem currently being addressed.
5. Challenges: Any ongoing challenges or obstacles faced.
6. Next Steps: Planned actions or goals for the immediate future.
7. Important Details: Crucial information such as specific technologies, libraries, or methodologies being used.
8. Open Questions: Any unresolved issues or decisions that need to be made.

## Step 4

Create a markdown document in active_tasks/{current_task}/session_logs/ called {CURRENT_TIMESTAMP_current_task}.md. You must use the current timestamp - use a tool if needed to do this.

Format your session log using clear headings for each section to ensure easy readability and quick reference. Be thorough in your summary, providing full context for the next session, but also be concise enough for quick comprehension.

Think about this as your handoff to the next AI Coding Agent.

Your final output should be a cohesive session log that seamlessly integrates information from the previous log and the current session. Present your session log within <session_log> tags. Do not include any other text or explanations outside of these tags in your final response.
